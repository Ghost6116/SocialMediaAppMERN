Utilizing React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB I have built a Full Stack MERN Application - beginning to end. The Application is classified as "Memories" and a basic social media app, which is purely for learning application that permits clients to post fascinating things that occurred in their lives.

Social Media App
Welcome to the repository for our Social Media App, a comprehensive platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This application is designed to simulate a real-world social media environment where users can interact through posts, comments, and likes.

Features
User Authentication: Users can register and log in to their accounts. Authentication is handled securely with JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that user sessions are maintained safely.
Post Creation and Management: Users can create posts with text content and images. Each post allows for operations such as edit and delete, giving users full control over their content.
Interactive Feed: The main feed dynamically displays posts from all users. Users can interact with posts by liking and commenting, fostering a community environment.
Real-Time Updates: Utilizes socket programming to update the feed in real-time, ensuring users see the most recent posts without needing to refresh the page.
Responsive Design: The front end is built using React.js to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface that adapts to different device screens.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js for building the dynamic and responsive user interface.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js serve as the backend framework handling the business logic, database operations, and server-side authentication.
Database: MongoDB is used for storing user data, posts, comments, likes, and other relational data efficiently.
Security: bcrypt for hashing user passwords before storing them in the database, and JWT for managing user sessions.
